# SwiftRSS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tibo/SwiftRSS.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tibo/SwiftRSS)

SwiftRSS is a simple RSS parser written in Swift.

## Todo

- [x] Basic RSS Support
- [x] Handle internet dates (RFC822 & RFC3339)
- [x] Tests with several RSS feeds (Swift official blog, Wordpress, Tumblr)
- [x] Handle Feed headers
- [x] NSCoder compatibility
- [x] Handle Comment link, feed and count (specific to Wordpress)
- [x] Add images helper (an array of images URL like for BlockRSSParser)
- [x] Continuous integration
- [x] Cocoapods spec

## Installation

- Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/?q=swiftrss), just add this line to your Podfile:

`pod 'SwiftRSS', '~> 0.0'`

- Installing this module manualy : Copy the content of the SwiftRSS folder and add it to your project.

- You can also use this project as Git [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).

## Usage

This library is pretty simple to use.
All you need to do is to create a simple `NSURLRequest` with the URL of your feed and then use the `parseFeedForRequest()` method with the callback closure to be able to use your items or handle errors properly.

```swift
let request: NSURLRequest = NSURLRequest(URL: NSURL(string: http://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/news.rss))

RSSParser.parseFeedForRequest(request, callback: { (feed, error) -> Void in
  NSLog("Feed for : \(feed.title)")
  NSLog("contains : \(feed.items)")
})
```

As results you get a [RSSFeed](https://github.com/tibo/SwiftRSS/blob/master/SwiftRSS/RSSFeed.swift) object which contain a array of [RSSItem](https://github.com/tibo/SwiftRSS/blob/master/SwiftRSS/RSSItem.swift)s or, if something wrong happen the `NSError` which will give you the error from the network call or the parsing process.

## How to contribute

If you need help on how to setup this project or how to use it, please use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swiftrss).

If you notice a bug, please open an issue with all the details and code to reproduce this issue.

If you want to contribute to the project, fix something or add a feature please fork this project, work in a seperate branch, and send a pull request. 
**Also please consider the following section about custom feeds and specific usecases**


## Custom feeds and specific usecases

This project is made to be a really simple RSS Parser for a basic news feed. You may need to parse more nodes if you want to use it with a custom feed (iTunes feed for instance).
With [BlockRSSParser](http://github.com/tibo/BlockRSSParser) I used to say that this kind of usage isn't really related to the originial philosophy of the project.

Now I think the best thing to do is to move these special use case to seperate branches.

If you want to adapt this project to a specific usecase, please fork the project, create a new branch named explicitly and send a pull request.
