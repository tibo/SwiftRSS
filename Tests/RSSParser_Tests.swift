                XCTAssert(myItem.itemDescription == " This post explores how optionals help preserve strong type safety within Swift. We’re going to create a Swift version of an Objective-C API. Swift doesn’t really need this API, but it makes for a fun example.  In Objective-C,  NSDictionary  has a method  -objectsForKeys:notFoundMarker:  that takes an  NSArray  of keys, and returns an  NSArray  of corresponding values. From the documentation: “the  N -th object in the returned array corresponds to the  N -th key in [the input parameter] keys.” What if the third key isn’t actually in the dictionary? That’s where the  notFoundMarker  parameter comes in. The third element in the array will be this marker object rather than a value from the dictionary. The Foundation framework even provides a class for this case if you don’t have another to use:  NSNull .  In Swift, the  Dictionary  type doesn’t have an  objectsForKeys  equivalent. For this exercise, we’re going to add one — as  valuesForKeys  in keeping with the common use of ‘value’ in Swift — using an extension:  [view code in blog]  This is where our new implementation in Swift will differ from Objective-C. In Swift, the stronger typing restricts the resulting array to contain only a single type of element — we can’t put  NSNull  in an array of strings. However, Swift gives an even better option: we can return an  array of optionals . All our values get wrapped in optionals, and instead of  NSNull , we just use  nil .  [view code in blog]  NOTE: Some of you may have guessed why a Swift  Dictionary  doesn’t need this API, and already imagined something like this:  [view code in blog]  This has the exact same effect as the imperative version above, but all of the boilerplate has been wrapped up in the call to  map .

Over the course of nearly 100 pull requests, I managed to get my hands on almost every piece of the app, from design changes to code refactors to some sweet new features.<br/><br/>The best part about the summer was working alongside multiple teams at Tumblr (iOS, Creative, API) making real, significant changes to one of the most polished apps on the App Store. When the summer started, I’d never written a custom animation, but after a few weeks I was helping to debug some of the fun things we do with CoreAnimation. Monday of my second week I found a bug in the API and got to spend a day looking through PHP code to help track that down. One Friday, I started work on some new things that will come out soon—at 5 pm, on a whim. By Monday, I was demoing the changes to Peter Vidani. That sort of rapid feedback is incredible, and really made my experience at Tumblr a joy—I got to make a real difference on the app.<br/><br/>In addition to the code I wrote (which was a lot!), I got to work with the team on all of the other facets of the app development lifecycle, from the existential frustration of dealing with translations to setting up a CI build server. I review several hundred pull requests, and spent hours discussing code with brilliant collegues who were never hesitant to debate the intricacies of what we were working on.<br/><br/>Throughout the summer, I was constantly in awe of the amazing work done at Tumblr every day. I’m proud to say that I got to contribute to the next few updates, and will forever cherish the experiences I had during my time at Tumblr HQ.<br/><br/></p></div>", "")

I didn’t really know what to expect when I first stepped in to the office, but whatever hopes and expectations I could have had, the summer far surpassed them.<br/><br/>The Creation team is in charge of one of the most important parts of the Tumblr site - posting tools - and most of my summer was spent working with the others on the team to overhaul the code underlying that part of the site. Coming in at the beginning of the summer, I could count the number of times I had worked in an existing codebase on one hand - namely: once, maybe twice. But with the help of the incredible Creation team, I dove right in and started contributing bug fixes, updates, and even entire features. Starting in the very first week I was already writing and deploying code, fixing a bug with note counts and updating Tumblr’s user engagement emails. By the end of the summer, I found myself getting ownership of pretty significant parts of the project. Even better, I had learned how to easily track down the source of a bug, figure out what this or that bit of code actually did, and navigate the figurative jungle of javascript.<br/><br/>It was incredibly exciting and rewarding to work on such a central part of the Tumblr site, knowing that people are going to be using some of the code I wrote to make millions of posts a day. I learned a tremendous amount about front-end web development, going from knowing a pretty minimal amount of javascript to knowing all sorts of intricacies about browser implementations and fluently speaking backbone.js and underscore.js.<br/><br/>Working at Tumblr really was a dream come true, and though I’m excited to get back to my friends at MIT, I’ve realized that this is absolutely something I could do for the rest of my life (or the foreseeable future, at least). Spending the day bringing ideas to life for Tumblr’s millions of users, surrounded by the most creative, smart, and friendly people I’ve ever met - It almost feels like cheating that I got to call that “work”.<br/><br/></p>", "")
